** kubernetes metrics
   Kubernetes has a new metrics called Millicores that is used to measure CPU
usage. It is a CPU core split into 1000 units. It’s a pretty self evident unit
of measure if you stop to think about it (milli = 1000). If you have 4 cores,
then the CPU capacity of the node is 4000m. 4 * 1000m = 4000m If you’re using
1/10 of a single core, then you are using 100m.
